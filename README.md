# Rust Tutorial - Vector Stats

We are going to build a Rust project from scratch to print out some metadata and summary statistics for a Vector. Useful in real-life systems? Doubtful. Fun? Oh yes ðŸ¦€ðŸ¤“

## Start Here to Experiment

Easily run with `cargo run`, or to step through individual steps:

```
cargo build
./target/debug/vector-stats
```

When making changes but not actually runnning your program, go ahead and run `cargo check` to verify it will compile. I still love it!
